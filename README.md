⏱️ Pomodoro Timer Project
This project is a productivity tool based on the Pomodoro Technique, which helps improve focus and time management. The timer allows users to:

Set work sessions (25 minutes by default).

Take short and long breaks after completing tasks.

Start, pause, reset, and skip sessions with easy controls.

Stay productive by breaking work into manageable intervals.

It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a simple and user-friendly interface that works on both desktop and mobile devices.
